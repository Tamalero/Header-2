## Hero Video Startup Framework

Modern websites use fullscreen videos to offer their visitors an interactive and entertaining experience.

The Hero Video header module can be easily added to your existing HubSpot website and allows you to embed videos from Wistia, YouTube and Vimeo.

You can add a fullscreen background video and a video that is shown if the user clicks on the play button. The module is working well on mobile devices and is fully responsive.

Choose any video from YouTube, Wistia and Vimeo and use the power of video on your website. You can tell stories, explain your product or just show a beautiful landscape.

The Hero Video header module is part of the Startup Framework template which can be found here:
